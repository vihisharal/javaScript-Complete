    <h3>Let's build fun quize game in the console</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: decimal-leading-zero">
        <li>Build a function constructor called quation to describe a quation.A quation should include: <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
            <li>quation itself</li>
            <li>the answer from which the player can choose the correct one (choose an adequate data structure here,array,object,etc.)</li>
            <li>correct answer (I would use a number for this)</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Create couple of quations using the constructor</li>
        <li>Store them all inside an array</li>
        <li>Select one random quation and log it oon the console,together with the possible answers (each quation should have a number)(Hint:write a quation for the quation object for this task.)</li>
        <li>use the 'prompt' function to ask the use for coorect answer.The user should input the number of correct answer such as you displayed it on task 4</li>
        <li>check if the answer is correct and print to the console whether the answer is correct or not (hint: write another method for this)</li>
        <li>Suppose this code would be a plugin for other programmers to use in their code.So make sure that all your code is private and doesn't interfare with the other programer code(Hint: we learned a special technique to do exactly that).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Expert Level</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;margin-left: -30px;">
        <li>08. After you display the result,display the next random quation,so that the game never end.(Hint: write afunction for this and call it right after displaying the result) </li>
        <li>09. Be careful after task 8 the game literally never ends.So include the option to quit the game iff the user writes 'exit' instead of answer.In this case don't call function from the task 8</li>
        <li>10. Track the user's score to make the game more fun! so each time answer is correct.add 1 point to the score (Hint: use the power of closures for this,but you don't have to,just do this with the tools you feel more comfortable at this point).</li>
        <li>11. Display the score in the console.use yet anthor method for it.</li>
    </ul>
